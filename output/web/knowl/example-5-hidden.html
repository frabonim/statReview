<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>One place where you can consistently see the general idea of hypothesis testing in action is in criminal trials held in the United States. Our criminal justice system assumes "the defendant is innocent until proven guilty." That is, our initial assumption is that the defendant is innocent.</p> <p>In the practice of statistics, we make our initial assumption when we state our two competing hypotheses -- the null hypothesis (<span class="process-math">\(H_0\)</span>) and the alternative hypothesis (<span class="process-math">\(H_A\)</span>). Here, our hypotheses are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(H_0\text{:}\)</span> Defendant is not guilty (innocent)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(H_A\text{:}\)</span> Defendant is guilty</p></li>
</ul> <p>In statistics, we always assume the null hypothesis is true. That is, the null hypothesis is always our initial assumption.</p> <p>The prosecution team then collects evidence  such as finger prints, blood spots, hair samples, carpet fibers, shoe prints, ransom notes, and handwriting samples  with the hopes of finding "sufficient evidence" to make the assumption of innocence refutable.</p> <p>In statistics, the <em class="emphasis">data</em> are the evidence.</p> <p>The jury then makes a decision based on the available evidence:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If the jury finds sufficient evidence  beyond a reasonable doubt  to make the assumption of innocence refutable, the jury <em class="emphasis">rejects the null hypothesis</em> and deems the defendant guilty. We behave as if the defendant is guilty.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is insufficient evidence, then the jury <em class="emphasis">does not reject the null hypothesis</em>. We behave as if the defendant is innocent.</p></li>
</ul> <p>In statistics, we always make one of two decisions. We either "reject the null hypothesis" or we "fail to reject the null hypothesis."</p></article></body>
