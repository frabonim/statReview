<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>The main campus at Penn State University has a population of approximately 42,000 students. A research question is "what proportion of these students smoke regularly?" A survey was administered to a sample of 987 Penn State students. Forty-three percent (43%) of the sampled students reported that they smoked regularly. How confident can we be that 43% is close to the actual proportion of all Penn State students who smoke?</p> <p>What is the population of interest? What is the parameter of interest? What is the sample? What statistic will be computed?</p>
