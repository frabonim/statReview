Of the 1,027 U.S. adults randomly selected for participation in the poll, 69% thought that it should be illegal. The reporter claimed that the poll's <dfn class="terminology">margin of error</dfn> was 3%. Therefore, the confidence interval for the (unknown) population proportion <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is 69% Â± 3%. That is, we can be really confident that between 66% and 72% of all U.S. adults think using a hand-held cell phone while driving a car should be illegal.</div></article></body>
