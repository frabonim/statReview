</h3>
<div class="para">Consider the population of many, many adults. A researcher hypothesized that the average adult body temperature is lower than the often-advertised 98.6 degrees F. That is, the researcher wants an answer to the question: "Is the average adult body temperature 98.6 degrees? Or is it lower?" To answer his research question, the researcher starts by assuming that the average adult body temperature was 98.6 degrees F.</div> <div class="para">Then, the researcher went out and tried to find evidence that refutes his initial assumption. In doing so, he selects a random sample of 130 adults. The average body temperature of the 130 sampled adults is 98.25 degrees.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Then, the researcher uses the data he collected to make a decision about his initial assumption. It is either <em class="emphasis">likely</em> or <em class="emphasis">unlikely</em> that the researcher would collect the evidence he did given his initial assumption that the average adult body temperature is 98.6 degrees:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">If it is <em class="emphasis">likely</em>, then the researcher <em class="emphasis">does not reject</em> his initial assumption that the average adult body temperature is 98.6 degrees. There is not enough evidence to do otherwise.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">If it is <em class="emphasis">unlikely</em>, then:</div>
<ul class="circle">
<li><div class="para">either the researcher's initial assumption is correct and he experienced a very unusual event;</div></li>
<li><div class="para">or the researcher's initial assumption is incorrect.</div></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div class="para">In statistics, we generally don't make claims that require us to believe that a very unusual event happened. That is, in the practice of statistics, if the evidence (data) we collected is unlikely in light of the initial assumption, then we reject our initial assumption.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_hyptest.html#example-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
