<p>The population mean \(\mu\) (the greek letter "mu") and the population proportion \(p\) are two different population parameters. For example:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>We might be interested in learning about \(\mu\text{,}\) the average weight of all middle-aged female Americans. The population consists of all middle-aged female Americans, and the parameter is \(\mu\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Or, we might be interested in learning about \(p\text{,}\) the proportion of likely American voters approving of the president's job performance. The population comprises all likely American voters, and the parameter is \(p\text{.}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that 99.999999999999... % of the time, we don't  or can't  know the real value of a population parameter. The best we can do is estimate the parameter! This is where samples and statistics come in to play.</p>
