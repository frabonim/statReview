<p>In our example concerning the mean grade point average, suppose again that our random sample of \(n = 15\) students majoring in mathematics yields a test statistic \(t^*\) instead equaling -2.5. The \(P\)-value for conducting the two-tailed test \(H_0: \mu = 3\) versus \(H_A: \mu \neq 3\) is the probability that we would observe a test statistic less than -2.5 or greater than 2.5 if the population mean \(\mu\) really were 3. That is, the two-tailed test requires taking into account the possibility that the test statistic could fall into either tail (and hence the name "two-tailed" test). The \(P\)-value is therefore the area under a \(t_{n - 1} = t_{14}\) curve to the left of -2.5 and to the right of the 2.5. It can be shown using statistical software that the \(P\)-value is 0.0127 + 0.0127, or 0.0254. The graph depicts this visually.</p>
