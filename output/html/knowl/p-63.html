<p>Specifically, the four steps involved in using the \(P\)-value approach to conducting any hypothesis test are:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Specify the null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
<li>Using the sample data and assuming the null hypothesis is true, calculate the value of the test statistic. Again, to conduct the hypothesis test for the population mean \(\mu\text{,}\) we use the \(t\)-statistic \(t^*=\frac{\xbar-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}\) which follows a \(t\)-distribution with \(n - 1\) degrees of freedom.</li>
<li>Using the known distribution of the test statistic, calculate the <em class="emphasis">\(P\)-value</em>: "If the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability that we'd observe a more extreme test statistic in the direction of the alternative hypothesis than we did?" (Note how this question is equivalent to the question answered in criminal trials: "If the defendant is innocent, what is the chance that we'd observe such extreme criminal evidence?")</li>
<li>Set the significance level, \(\alpha\text{,}\) the probability of making a Type I error to be small -- 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10. Compare the \(P\)-value to \(\alpha\text{.}\) If the \(P\)-value is less than (or equal to) \(\alpha\text{,}\) reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the \(P\)-value is greater than \(\alpha\text{,}\) do not reject the null hypothesis.</li>
