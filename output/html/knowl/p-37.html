<p>Of course, to find the width of the confidence interval, we just take the difference in the two limits:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\text{Width } = \text{ Upper Limit - Lower Limit}
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>What factors affect the width of the confidence interval? We can examine this question by using the formula for the confidence interval and seeing what would happen should one of the elements of the formula be allowed to vary.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\xbar\pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1}\left(\dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>What is the width of the \(t\)-interval for the mean? If you subtract the lower limit from the upper limit, you get:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather*}
\text{Width }=2 \times t_{\alpha/2, n-1}\left(\dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
\end{gather*}
</div>
<p>Now, let's investigate the factors that affect the length of this interval. Convince yourself that each of the following statements is accurate:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>As the sample mean increases, the length stays the same. That is, the sample mean plays no role in the width of the interval.</li>
<li>As the sample standard deviation <em class="emphasis">s</em> decreases, the width of the interval decreases. Since <em class="emphasis">s</em> is an estimate of how much the data vary naturally, we have little control over <em class="emphasis">s</em> other than making sure that we make our measurements as carefully as possible.</li>
<li>As we decrease the confidence level, the <em class="emphasis">t</em>-multiplier decreases, and hence the width of the interval decreases. In practice, we wouldn't want to set the confidence level below 90%.</li>
<li>As we increase the sample size, the width of the interval decreases. This is the factor that we have the most flexibility in changing, the only limitation being our time and financial constraints.</li>
</ul>
