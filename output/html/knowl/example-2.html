<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="codenumber">2</span>. <span class="title">Are the grades of college students inflated?</span>
</h6>
<p>Let's suppose that there exists a population of 7 million college students in the United States today. (The actual number depends on how you define "college student.") And, let's assume that the average GPA of all of these college students is 2.7 (on a 4-point scale). If we take a random sample of 100 college students, how likely is it that the sampled 100 students would have an average GPA as large as 2.9 if the population average was 2.7?</p>
<p>What is the population of interest? What is the parameter of interest? What is the sample? What statistic will be computed?</p>
