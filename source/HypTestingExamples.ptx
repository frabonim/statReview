	<title>Right-Tailed Test</title>
	<p>
		A biologist was interested in determining whether sunflower seedlings treated with an extract from Vinca minor roots resulted in a lower average height of sunflower seedlings than the standard height of 15.7 cm. The biologist treated a random sample of <m>n = 33</m> seedlings with the extract and subsequently obtained the following heights:

		The biologist's hypotheses are:
		<md>
			<mrow>H_0: \mu=15.7</mrow>
			<mrow>H_a: \mu &lt; 15.7</mrow>

		The biologist entered her data into R and ran the <c>t.test</c> function. She obtained the following output:
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="90%">
		<pre>
			One Sample t-test

			data:  Heartrates
			t = -4.60, df = 32, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
			alternative hypothesis: true mean is less than 15.7
			sample estimates:
			mean of x 
			 13.664
		</pre>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		The output tells us that the average height of the <m>n = 33</m> sunflower seedlings was 13.664. The test statistic <m>t^*</m> is -4.60, and the <m>P</m>-value is less than <m>2.2\times 10^{-16}</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the biologist set her significance level, <m>\alpha</m> at 0.05, then she would see that the <m>P</m>-value is significantly less than <m>\alpha</m> and so she has strong evidence that the mean of all such sunflower seedlings is less than 15.7 cm.

		The engineer hypothesized that the mean Brinell hardness of all such ductile iron pieces is greater than 170. Therefore, he was interested in testing the hypotheses:
		<md>
			<mrow>H_0: \mu=170</mrow>
			<mrow>H_a: \mu &gt; 170</mrow>
		</md>
		The engineer entered his data into R and ran the <c>t.test</c> function to obtain the following output:
	</p>
	<sidebyside width="90%">
		<pre>
			One Sample t-test

			data:  Heartrates
			t = 1.22, df = 24, p-value 0.177
			alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 170
			sample estimates:
			mean of x 
			 172.52
		</pre>
	</sidebyside>
	<p>
		The output tells us that the average Brinell hardness of the <m>n = 25</m> pieces of ductile iron was 172.52. The test statistic <m>t^*</m> is 1.22, and the <m>P</m>-value is 0.117.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the engineer set his significance level, <m>\alpha</m> at 0.05, then he would see that the <m>P</m>-value is greater than <m>\alpha</m> and so we do not have evidence that the mean Brinell hardness of all such ductile iron pieces is greater than 170.
